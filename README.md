## For students and advisors
Budgeting tool + plain-language explainer + calculator:  
https://www.thepricer.org/student/resources/

That is the link colleges and student support staff share with students.  
It turns this dataset into an estimate of “How many hours do I have to work each month just to stay housed, fed, connected, and enrolled?”

## What this repo is
This repository publishes SEAT v1.2 (Student Affordability Toolkit), an open dataset that measures **Monthly Survival Hours (MSH)** for U.S. students.

**Monthly Survival Hours (MSH)** =  
How many paid work hours a typical student must sell each month to cover:
- shared off-campus rent + utilities
- groceries / basic food
- local transportation
- phone + internet
- books / supplies
- uncovered tuition / fees

The timeline currently covers **1990–2025**.

We provide the data in two ways:
- Dollar costs per month for each category
- The same basket expressed in hours of work at that year’s federal minimum wage (adjusted to approximate take-home pay)

These numbers are designed for:
- financial aid / basic-needs / student success staff
- orientation / first-year budgeting workshops
- journalists covering cost-of-attendance, retention risk, and student work burden
- policy / completion / basic-needs teams
